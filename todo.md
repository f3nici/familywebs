I would like to make a view only website option that has JSON file locally. I have created a branch called ViewOnly this is what will be updated.

It should look for a local JSON file called family.json and use that instead of import and export

The UI needs to have some changes:
- Only show as View only mode - Remove the toggle as there will be no edit options.
- On Web view remove the Regenerate button
- Remove the Export and Import Buttons

Remove all features that wont be needed for this.
